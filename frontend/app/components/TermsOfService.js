        or inconsistent provision in the Terms of Use. No waiver of any right or remedy on one
        occasion by Compliance.ai shall be deemed a waiver of such right or remedy on any other
        occasion. In the event that any provision of the Terms of Use is held by a court of
        competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall
        be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the
