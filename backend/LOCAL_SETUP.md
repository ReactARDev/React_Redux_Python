### Prerequisites recommndation
    * Python 2.7
         Do not start to setup your environment relaying on the pre installed python; instead make sure you use brew to
         install the python from scratch:
         ```
         brew install python
         ```
         then add/update the path in your .bash\_profile
    * PostgreSQL 9.4
       if you have already a 10.xx version installed, make sure to safely uninstall that version, and use brew to
       install verion 9.4
       ```
       brew search postgresql
       brew install postgresql@9.4
       ```
       then add/update the path in your .bash\_profile
